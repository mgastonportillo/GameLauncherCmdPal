Game Launcher is an extension for [PowerToys Command Palette (CmdPal)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/command-palette/overview).  
It allows you to run all your games from a single searchable list within CmdPal.

## Disclaimers
> [!WARNING]
> This project is a work in progress. It's also my first experience with C#, CmdPal, PowerToys and Windows Apps in general. Bugs **are to be expected**.
- This is a personal project. I'm using it for learning purposes, but if there's enough interest I might change the approach.
- Recommendations are welcome so feel free to open issues.

## Roadmap
- Read game shortcuts from a custom folder and launch them âœ…
- Read games from **Steam**, **Xbox** and **Epic Games** initially
- Read games from other game platforms
- Add ability to hide games and manage hidden games
- Add other advanced options

## Instructions
By now, you'll need to build it yourself. Microsoft is preventing me from publishing the extension on their store, so I either figure that out or go an alternative path.
